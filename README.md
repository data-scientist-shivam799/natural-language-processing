Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. It involves analyzing, understanding, and generating human language, which can be in the form of text, speech, or any other type of communication. NLP techniques are used to develop applications such as chatbots, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition.
